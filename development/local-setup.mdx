title: 'Local Development Setup'
description: 'Set up your local development environment for the Shopify RSS Feed to Google Chat service'
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest version)
- A code editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Git

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the project to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd shopify-rss-feed-gchat
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install all required packages using Bun:
    
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    
    This will install the following dependencies:
    - `hono` - Fast web framework for routing
    - `rss-parser` - RSS feed parsing library
    - `@types/bun` - TypeScript types for Bun
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    
    ```bash
    touch .env
    ```
    
    Add your Google Chat webhook URL:
    
    ```bash .env
    WEBHOOK_URL=https://chat.googleapis.com/v1/spaces/YOUR_SPACE_ID/messages?key=YOUR_KEY
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Bun automatically loads `.env` files, so no additional configuration is needed.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple, modular structure:

```
shopify-rss-feed-gchat/
├── server.ts              # Main Hono server with routing
├── rss-handler.ts         # RSS feed processing logic
├── package.json           # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
├── vercel.json            # Vercel deployment config with cron
├── .env                   # Environment variables (not in repo)
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

### Key Files

<Accordion title="server.ts">
  The main application server using Hono framework:
  - Defines routes for healthcheck and RSS feed processing
  - Exports the app for Vercel deployment
  - Located at: `server.ts:1`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="rss-handler.ts">
  Core RSS feed processing logic:
  - Fetches Shopify changelog RSS feed
  - Filters new items since last check
  - Formats and sends messages to Google Chat
  - Located at: `rss-handler.ts:1`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="vercel.json">
  Deployment configuration:
  - Defines cron job to run daily at midnight UTC
  - Triggers `/get-rss-feed` endpoint
  - Located at: `vercel.json:1`
</Accordion>

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This command runs `bun run --hot server.ts`, which:
- Starts the Hono server
- Enables hot module reloading (automatically restarts on file changes)
- Makes the API available at `http://localhost:3000`

<Tip>
  The `--hot` flag enables Bun's built-in hot reloading, so you don't need nodemon or similar tools.
</Tip>

## Available Endpoints

Once the server is running, you can access:

### Healthcheck
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/healthcheck
```
Returns "Running!" to verify the server is up.

### RSS Feed Handler
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/get-rss-feed
```
Processes the Shopify RSS feed and sends updates to Google Chat.

## Development Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the dev server">
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make changes to the code">
    Edit files in your code editor. The server will automatically reload when you save changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your changes">
    Use curl, Postman, or your browser to test the endpoints.
    
    See the [Testing Guide](/development/testing) for detailed testing instructions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript settings for better code quality:

- **Target**: ESNext (latest JavaScript features)
- **Module**: Preserve (for Bun's bundler)
- **Strict mode**: Enabled
- **JSX**: react-jsx (if needed for future UI components)

<Note>
  Bun has built-in TypeScript support, so no separate compilation step is needed.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Port already in use">
  If port 3000 is already in use, Bun will automatically try the next available port. Check the console output for the actual port number.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WEBHOOK_URL not set error">
  Make sure you've created a `.env` file with a valid `WEBHOOK_URL`. The application will throw an error if this is missing when trying to send messages.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Module not found errors">
  Run `bun install` again to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
</Accordion>
