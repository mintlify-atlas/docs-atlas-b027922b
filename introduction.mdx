# Shopify RSS Feed to Google Chat

Stay up-to-date with Shopify's latest developer updates without constantly checking the changelog. This service automatically monitors the Shopify Developer Changelog RSS feed and sends formatted notifications to your Google Chat space.

## What This Service Does

This lightweight service fetches the [Shopify Developer Changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog/feed.xml), filters for new entries, and delivers beautifully formatted card notifications to Google Chat. Built with Bun and Hono for blazing-fast performance, it runs on a scheduled cron job to keep your team informed about API changes, new features, deprecations, and breaking changes.

## How It Works

The service operates through a simple yet effective workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scheduled Trigger">
    A Vercel cron job triggers the `/get-rss-feed` endpoint daily at midnight UTC
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fetch & Parse">
    The service fetches the Shopify changelog RSS feed and parses it using `rss-parser`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter New Items">
    Compares feed items against the last processed date to identify new changelog entries published since yesterday
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Format & Send">
    Formats new items into Google Chat cards with titles, dates, links, and sends them via webhook
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

### Smart Filtering
The service maintains state to track the last processed date, ensuring you only receive notifications for genuinely new changelog entries. It initializes with yesterday's date and updates after each successful run.

### Rich Notifications
Each Google Chat message includes:
- Card header with update count and latest date
- Individual changelog items with bookmark icons
- Formatted dates in readable format (e.g., "December 12, 2025")
- Direct links to full changelog entries
- Quick access button to view all changelogs

### Production-Ready
Deployed on Vercel with zero-configuration cron scheduling. The `vercel.json` configuration handles automated daily execution, and environment variables provide secure webhook management.

<Info>
  The service uses the official Shopify Developer Changelog RSS feed at `https://shopify.dev/changelog/feed.xml`
